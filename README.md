sqlc generates **type-safe code** from SQL. Here's how it works:

1. You write queries in SQL.
1. You run sqlc to generate code with type-safe interfaces to those queries.
1. You write application code that calls the generated code.

Check out [an interactive example](https://play.sqlc.dev/) to see it in action.
